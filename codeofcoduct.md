# Code of Conduct

Please act in a [Graciously Professional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbxn9cQOQd4) and respectful manner at all times.

Disrespectful behavior is not tolerated.  Bigotry (including racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and all other forms of discrimination) is contrary to the concept of Gracious Professionalism, and is not acceptable in this diverse community.

The time of all volunteers is valuable. Attempts to stir drama and cause chaos are also considered disrespectful to all members of the project, who are here to create and use high quality software.

Disrespectful profile pictures, statuses, and usernames fall under this rule. You may be asked to change them.

A large portion of the community is under 18 years of age - all interactions shall comply with [FIRST's latest YPP guidelines.](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/youth-protection-program)

The Community Guidelines for FIRST® Online Discussions are also in effect and should be followed at all times.

Project Leads bear final responsibility for interpreting, applying, and executing this code of conduct.
